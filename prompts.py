"""Prompt template for an optional LLM hook.

This file defines a Jinja2 template that can be used to generate a
prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM) based on the student profile
and preliminary recommendations produced by the ruleâ€‘based engine.  The
current application does **not** call any external LLM; the prompt
template is provided purely for future extension.
